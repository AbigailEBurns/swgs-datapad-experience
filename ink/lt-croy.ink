Good day, passenger.
I am Lt. Harmon Croy of the First Order.
My investigations of Resistance activity have led me to this ship.
I am prepared to look deeper and find concrete evidence of Resistance activity onboard the Halcyon starcruiser.

Ah...perhaps to you it seems that way.
I suspect there is something lying below that fa√ßade.
If you refuse to help me, I will find the evidence I needd another way.

I'd rather not.
I expect a ship of this class to play host to a better clientele than a scoundrel...it seems I may be mistaken.
Be careful with how you play your cards.
We shall see how your little game plays out.

<strong>(18:07)</strong>
In compliance with the First Order inquiry into the crew of the Halcyon starcruiser, I must interrupt your sailing for a brief investigation.
As a citizen and passenger, I expect full compliance.

I was not impressed by that droid's cheek at muster and I intend to find out what it knows.

Have you noticed any suspicious activity surrounding Miss Mok's droid, SK-620?

    * [No, nothing suspicious at all.]
        -> nothing_suspicious
    * That droid has Resistance data.

I see - well, I will advise you to be a bit more observant.
You would ldo well to carefully choose where your loyalties lie.
I believe I will need to inspect that droid and extract its information - with our without your help.

I am obtaining supplies from my First Order superiors to interrogate the droid, SK-620.
While my troopers track hikm down, I want to learn more about this ship and how it operates.
Can I rely on your assistance?

If I find the crew of this ship are indeed Resistance operatives, we must have a way to secure it when - if - the time comes.
That means learning a little more about how it works.
Ship schematics would be very useful in this endeavour.
I will not ask again - will you be loyal to the First Order and assist with this mission?

Ah, I see.
I must advise you that the evidence is mounting against this crew.
Be careful - do not get caught on the wrong side of this conflict.
