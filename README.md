We need your help

If you are cruising soon, or you just got off today, can you record the dialogue of all the character chats and send it my way?

Here's how to record your screen (iPhone) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935 Note: The dialog disappears around 2pm on the day of your departure! Just start the record, scroll to the top of each character's dialogue and scroll down. You don't even have to scroll slow.

Please PM the videos to me or I can setup a dropbox, gdrive or whatever you need.

We're working on creating a full dialogue of all scenarios and could really use your help!

Thanks!
